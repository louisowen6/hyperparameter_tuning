# Hyperparameter Tuning in Python

This is the code implmentation of the published Medium Article: [The Art of Hyperparameter Tuning inÂ Python](https://louisowen6.medium.com/the-art-of-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-c581a129d4e4).

The article covers all useful hyperparameter tuning methods in one place. You will not only learn the concept of each of the hyperparameter tuning methods but also when you should use each of them. Moreover, the explanation will also be accompanied by the relevant visualization that can help you understand better how each of the methods works.

There are 6 methods that will be discussed in this article:
1) Grid Search
2) Random Search
3) Coarse to Fine Search
4) Bayesian Search
5) Genetic Algorithm
6) Manual Search
